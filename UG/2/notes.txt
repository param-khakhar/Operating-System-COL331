What is ELF?

ELF is the file format used for object files (.o's), binaries, shared libraries and core dumps in Linux.

What is core dump?

The Linux kernel can write a file containing the state of a process when the process receives certain signals,
e.g. segmentation fault or illegal instruction. Such files are called core dumps and contain a snapshot of the 
allocated memory and registers and can later be used with gdb to analyse the causes of the signal.
